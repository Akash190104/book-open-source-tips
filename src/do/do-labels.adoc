=== GitHub Labels

These are really useful for various reasons:

- Helps people filter their results, for example by `defect`, `idea` etc
- If people want to contribute to your project a label that states `help needed` will stand out
- Difficultly level. Contributors can filter by a level they are comfortable with

TIP: Have different labels but dont go label crazy, 10-20 is about right
