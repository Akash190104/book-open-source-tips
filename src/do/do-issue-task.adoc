=== Issue / Task

Keep these small. Tackling a large piece of work is always daunting and more difficult to find the time. The smaller the tasks, the more likely it is to be done and the lower risk it will be. But remember the task still needs to provide value to the project.

Include diagrams, screenshots, sub tasks & anything visual to help describe the issue & changes.

Tip: Dont forget you can use a sub task checklist on https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments[GitHub Issues Checklist]. Sub task list are prepended with `[ ]` for incomplete & `[x]` for complete items.
