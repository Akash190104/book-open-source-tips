=== Branching

Branching is important when working with a team, and even more important when working with a wider team you dont even know yet.

Protect your mainline branch (usually `master` or `develop`) and everything must go via a feature branch and a **Pull Request**. This should be the same for everyone, public contributors and approved maintainers.

TIP: There are many branching strategies, one example is *Gitflow*, many people use part of   http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[Gitflow].
